				It's not so easy to define what I do. Okay... It IS, I just did it; but you have to be really vague and unhelpful about it.
				This here 'folio is to catalogue all of the things I think are cool enough to show off, and also the other stuff just in case.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				I live in Colorado, and close enough to Boulder that I can see the occasional weed clouds waft through the sky.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				I've been writing, programming, drawing, and creating for pretty much forever, and I have folders within folders of ideas for projects I've never had the time to get around to.
			</p>
			<br>
			<img src = "assets/images/20190318_071126.jpg" alt = "I love this view">
			<br>
			<p>
				I absolutely love this scene, it's been my daily drive from work ever since september.

				I've doodled in my spare time. I also write stories every so often which you can check out in the deviantart link aaaaaaaaaaall the way down at the bottom of the page.

			<br id = "linktoprojects">
			<p>
				But that's enough about me, let's get into the projects.

			<h1 class = "fontus-biggus">First major project</h1>
			<br><br>
			<img src = "assets/images/project_1.png" alt = "project 1">
			<br>
			<p>
				here's the results of my first major worked on project in javascript. 
				Using multiple APIs n stuff to search an area and bring up breweries and venues.
				the pompously named Hipster's Paradise.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				My contribution was mostly the front end and design, the interface the users mostly interact with.
				If you want to try it out yourself the repo is <a href = "https://github.com/ametueraspirant/Project1" class = "text-blue-500">here.</a>
			</p>
			<br><br><br>
			<p>
				Now, for the minor javascript projects let's go from least to most likely to bury me in copyright debt...
			</p>
			<br>
			<img src = "assets/images/trains.png" alt = "trains">
			<br>
			<p>
				This little beaute uses moment.js and some database stuff to calculate train arrival times based on a set of instructions. I did all of it. It was all me.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				I did get a bit listener happy and attached too many and forgot to remove them in time so it's initially buggy but all bugs are temporary I assure you.
			</p>
			<br>
			<img src = "assets/images/question.png" alt = "question">
			<br>
			<p>
				Here I played around with some DOM manipulation and timing and threw in a few fun facts while I was at it. This stands the test of time as my least buggy solo project to date.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				And once again if you'd like to try it out yourself the link is <a href = "https://github.com/ametueraspirant/trivia_game" class = "text-blue-500">here.</a>
			</p>
			<br>
			<img src = "assets/images/cookie.png" alt = "c is for crime boss">
			<br>
			<p>
				This one is probably my favorite. just because of the themes of western and sesame street. also all me. 100% a me project.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Again if you wish to try it out the link is <a href = "https://github.com/ametueraspirant/hang_the_mann" class = "text-blue-500">here.</a>
			</p>
			<br>
			<img src = "assets/images/smash.png" alt = "smash">
			<br>
			<p>
				Have mercy Nintendo it was for a JOKE okay?
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				<i>ahem...</i>
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				A little fighty type game that I totally overprogrammed for.
